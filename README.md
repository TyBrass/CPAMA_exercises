# CP:AMA
*C Programming: A Modern Approach* is an introductory C book written by K. N. King.
This repository is simply a collection of completed exercises and projects from the book.
Note: Not every exercise and project has been completed, with especially many missing from the early parts of the book. I'm far from even being considered proficient in C, but some exercises and projects felt outdated or felt otherwise unnecessary.
